# Hybrid Identity Access Reporter

## Overview
The Hybrid Identity Access Reporter provides a comprehensive 360-degree view of a user's identity, attributes, group memberships (including nested), role assignments, and effective permissions across both on-premises Active Directory and Entra ID environments.

## Features

### üîç **Identity Correlation**
- Searches for users across both Active Directory and Entra ID
- Supports multiple identifier types (UPN, sAMAccountName, employeeId)
- Validates identity correlation and detects conflicts
- Provides confidence scoring for identity matches

### üè¢ **Active Directory Analysis**
- Complete user attribute enumeration
- **Recursive nested group membership resolution** - shows the complete inheritance chain
- Privileged group membership detection
- Account status and security settings analysis
- Last logon and activity tracking

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Entra ID Analysis**
- User profile and attribute analysis
- Direct and transitive group memberships
- Administrative role assignments
- Application role assignments and permissions
- Sign-in activity analysis

### üìä **Risk Assessment**
- Automated risk scoring based on privileged access
- Risk level classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Detailed risk factor identification
- Privilege escalation path analysis

### üìÑ **Comprehensive Reporting**
- **HTML Report**: Visual, color-coded report with executive summary
- **JSON Export**: Structured data for integration with other tools
- **CSV Export**: Flattened data for spreadsheet analysis
- **All Formats**: Generate all report types simultaneously

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```powershell
# Generate HTML report for a user
.\Get-HybridIdentityAccessReport.ps1 -UserIdentifier "john.doe@contoso.com"

# Search by sAMAccountName
.\Get-HybridIdentityAccessReport.ps1 -UserIdentifier "jdoe" -OutputFormat "HTML"

# Generate all report formats
.\Get-HybridIdentityAccessReport.ps1 -UserIdentifier "john.doe@contoso.com" -OutputFormat "All"
```

### Advanced Usage
```powershell
# Custom configuration file
.\Get-HybridIdentityAccessReport.ps1 -UserIdentifier "john.doe@contoso.com" -ConfigPath ".\custom-config.json"

# Skip nested group analysis for faster execution
.\Get-HybridIdentityAccessReport.ps1 -UserIdentifier "john.doe@contoso.com" -IncludeNestedGroups:$false

# Debug mode with detailed logging
.\Get-HybridIdentityAccessReport.ps1 -UserIdentifier "john.doe@contoso.com" -LogLevel "DEBUG"
```

## Prerequisites

```powershell
# Install required modules
Install-Module ActiveDirectory
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Levels
- **Critical (25+)**: Multiple privileged roles, high-risk combinations
- **High (15-24)**: Privileged access, administrative roles
- **Medium (8-14)**: Some elevated permissions, group memberships
- **Low (0-7)**: Standard user access

### Risk Factors
- Privileged AD group memberships
- Administrative role assignments
- Multiple admin roles
- Cross-tenant access
- Unusual group combinations
- Inconsistent attributes between systems

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
- Use `-IncludeNestedGroups:$false` for faster execution when nested analysis isn't needed
- Configure `MaxNestingDepth` appropriately for your environment
- Run during off-peak hours for large environments
- Consider batch processing for multiple users

### Typical Performance
- **Standard User**: 10-30 seconds
- **Privileged User**: 30-60 seconds
- **Complex Nested Groups**: 1-3 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Problems
```powershell
# Verify Graph connection
Get-MgContext

# Reconnect if needed
Disconnect-MgGraph
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.Read.All","Group.Read.All","Directory.Read.All"
```

#### Active Directory Connectivity
```powershell
# Test AD connectivity
Get-ADDomain

# Verify user search
Get-ADUser -Filter "UserPrincipalName -eq 'test@domain.com'"
```

#### Permission Issues
- Verify Azure AD role assignments
- Check API permissions in Azure portal
- Ensure proper scopes during Graph authentication
- Confirm AD permissions for group queries

### Error Messages

#### "User not found in either Active Directory or Entra ID"
- Verify the user identifier is correct
- Check if the user exists in either system
- Try alternative identifiers (UPN vs sAMAccountName)

#### "Failed to connect to Microsoft Graph"
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify Azure AD permissions
- Ensure correct tenant context

#### "Maximum nesting depth reached"
- Increase `MaxNestingDepth` in configuration
- Check for circular group memberships
- Consider reducing scope for performance

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Reports may contain sensitive user information
- Store reports in secure locations
- Consider encrypting reports for sensitive environments
- Implement proper access controls for report files

### Audit Trail
- All operations are logged with timestamps
- User queries are tracked for compliance
- Failed attempts are recorded
- Consider SIEM integration for monitoring

### Least Privilege
- Use read-only permissions where possible
- Limit scope of analysis to necessary attributes
- Implement approval workflows for sensitive users
- Regular review of script permissions

## Integration

### SIEM Integration
Export JSON reports to SIEM platforms for:
- Automated risk alerting
- Trend analysis
- Compliance reporting
- Incident response support

### Identity Governance
Integrate with:
- Access review systems
- Privileged access management
